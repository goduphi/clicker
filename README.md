This game is a really bad copy of one of my friends game (Jonah Bui).

The only reason I made this game was to test out the limits of my Javascript and HTML5 Canvas skills. Never really did much Javascript, but the experience has been amazing and I am liking it more and more. I will probably add more features later on.
